* *Podcasting with Brennan* in **the closet**:  We’ll be talking about how to make a technical/programming-related podcast, that doesn’t suck! (which is hard)

* *Technical Interview Prep* with Allan Blair & Erinna Chen in **Classroom C**: Are you stressed about what a technical interview entails and feel completely unprepared? Don’t know how to write on a whiteboard? Come and get your questions answered about technical interviews, practice your Big-O notation, share your knowledge about those data structures and algorithms, and just generally keep those Ruby skills sharp.

* *maxMSP & Jitter, Creating realtime dynamic audio/visual experiences* with Jordan Lawler in **Classroom B**: Max MSP is a visual GUI language comparable to Pure Data that allows for efficient,  intuitive, and dynamic audio/visual processing.
