### What is Polymorphism? (9:30 - 10:00)

Let's talk about Polymorphism.

* Watch [this RailsCast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOFAcbxdWjY) up to 3:30. 
* Read [this blog post](https://richonrails.com/articles/polymorphic-associations-in-rails) and stop when you see the `rails g controller` stuff.
* Work in pairs to create the migrations and models that would represent this sitaution: The principal of a school needs to keep track of her meetings with students, parents, and employees. Create four models (`Student`, `Parent`, `Employee`, and `Meeting`) so that the first three models can have many meetings, and a meeting can belong to either a student, parent, or employee. Try out your associations in the console (`rails c`). Refer back to the RailsCast if you've forgotten how to do that.
