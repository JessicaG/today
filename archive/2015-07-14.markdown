Today in 1789, citizens of Paris storm the Bastille.

## All

### Warmup (8:30 - 9:00)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Five points by posting your working, well-tested solution in `#warmup-answers` with your full posse name before 9:00. _Bonus_: Steve will give five more points for a solution in JavaScript and ten more points for a solution using [ES6 generators][gen] (don't copy and paste) by 1:00. (The message was not approved by Mike.)

### JavaScript in Rails (9:00 - 10:30)

Join Steve. Classroom B.

Today, we'll talk a little bit about [Steve's Golden Rules][golden] for JavaScript in your Rails application.

* You'll learn how to structure your JavaScript code in a Rails project.
* You'll learn how the Asset Pipeline loads JavaScript and how it prepares it for production.
* You'll learn exposing data from Rails in the DOM using `data` attributes.

We'll be using the following resources:

* [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/javascript_in_rails.markdown)
* [Book of Faces](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/book_of_faces), you met this project in Module 2, but let's take another look at it and implement live search.
