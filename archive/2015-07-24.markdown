### GearUp (3:15 - 4:00)

Please be on time at 3:15 all piled into the workspace.

We're going to watch [this short TED talk by Simon Sinek: Start with Why](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en).

Then have a few minutes to write and think:

* Write a 2-3 paragraph answer to "Why you?" Why do you do what you do? Think
carefully about differentiating your "how" and "what" from your "why"
* Start over. Write a two paragraph version.
* Start over. Write a one paragraph version.
* At 3:52, grab a pair nearby you and share your why. It'll be awkward. That's ok.
