When you're not in your project assessment:

1. Finish up your portfolio and make sure your PR is current
2. Read and leave feedback (comments) on at least 2 portfolios from your cohort
3. Read and leave feedback (comments) on at least 2 portfolios from other cohorts

You understand what it means to be a Turing student better than most
anyone else. Please share that perspective and insight with the folks coming up behind you!
