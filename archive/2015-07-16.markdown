With those new understandings, dive back into the exercises and work on them
until lunch. Please try to push your Chisel aside -- the practice you do and
understandings you build with the Creatures will make your Chisel work go much
faster.

Start in Classroom A to complete your Week 2 diagnostic. Once you're done then
you can work where/how you please on Creatures or Chisel.
