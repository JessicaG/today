### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

A word snake is (unsurprisingly) a snake made up of a sequence of words.

For instance, take this sequence of words:

SHENANIGANS SALTY YOUNGSTER ROUND DOUBLET TERABYTE ESSENCE

Notice that the last letter in each word is the same as the first letter in the next word. In order to make this into a word snake, you simply snake it across the screen

Your task today is to take an input word sequence and turn it into a word snake. Here are the rules for the snake:

* It has to start in the top left corner
* Each word has to turn 90 degrees left or right to the previous word
* The snake can't intersect itself

Other than that, you're free to decide how the snake should "snake around". If you want to make it easy for yourself and simply have it alternate between going right and going down, that's perfectly fine. If you want to make more elaborate shapes, that's fine too.

Ten points by posting your working solution in #warmup-answers with your full posse name before 9:00.

We will be covering the following learning goals:

* Use jQuery's DOM traversal methods to move around the DOM
* Add CSS styles using jQuery
* Append new content to the DOM
* Add event listeners to elements currently in the DOM
* Understand that adding an event listener will not effect elements you add to the DOM in the future

We'll be referencing the following materials:

* [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/jquery_dom_traversal_and_manipulation.md)
* [The Presidents of the United States of America](http://output.jsbin.com/rejuya)
