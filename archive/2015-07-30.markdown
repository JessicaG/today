### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Thursday is JavaScript day!

Given the following two arrays:

var firstList = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"];

Write a function that removes all of the elements in the secondList from the firstList.

The result should be ["A", "B", "D"].

### Self-Directed Projects Intro (1:00 - 2:00)

Meet with Jorge in classroom B to talk about your Self-Directed project.

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

Successful completion of this project will earn you your `software developer` status.

You can check the projects specs [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown).

### Self-Directed Project Ideation & Prep (2:00 - 4:00)

To help with your ideation process, read the **High-Concept Pitches** and **Elevator Pitches** of **Pitching Hacks** by the cofounders of [AngelList](https://angel.co). These chapters are very short, practical, and easy to read (yes, I used an Oxford comma).

Develop three ideas for your individual projects. The ideas must solve a real problem. You should follow the template in the [specs](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown#project-concepts).

Make sure to explore the APIs you plan to use to assess the feasibility of your project.

**We will meet in classroom B after wrap-up to answer any questions.**

We will kickoff the project on Monday after lunch.
