### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Thursday is JavaScript day. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is your friend.

Pick a method from Ruby's Enumberable that is not map, collect, reduce, inject, each, or filter.

You may want to look to [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) for inspiration (but not for implementation).
