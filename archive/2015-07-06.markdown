### Homework Review (9:00 - 10:00)

Join Steve in Classroom B as you go over the homework that you did. You did
do it, right?

We'll review the [intermission assignments](https://github.com/turingschool/intermission-assignments/blob/master/prep-for-module-4.markdown), most specifically:

* [Mary Rose Cook live-codes a JavaScript game from scratch][mrc]
* [Sandi Metz's Five Rules for Developers][sandi]
* Ruby and JavaScript style guides
  * [thoughtbot's style guide for Ruby][tbruby]
  * [Airbnb's JavaScript style guide][airbnbjs]

[sandi]: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers
[tbruby]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style/ruby
[airbnbjs]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

### JavaScript Q&A (10:00 - 11:30)

Stick around in Classroom B.

Ideally, you've read through a few chapters of [Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/) and work through Rebecca Murphey's [JavaScript Assessment][assess].

[assess]: https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment

The main purpose of these assignments was to help you figure out what you know and what you don't know about JavaScript (the latter is likely a longer list than the former).

We're not going to be able to cover everything in 90 minutes, but we can plan out future sessions.

* [Etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/js-assessment)

Use the Etherpad above to record which sections you'd like to cover more in depth over the next six weeks.
