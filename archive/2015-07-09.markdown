Let's start together in Classroom A. For this afternoon session, work on [the Credit Check challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown). 

You should:

* let this be the last exercise where you don't write automated tests
* basically pretend you're writing automated tests, but just use manual test inputs / expected outputs
* do approach it using the spiral/iteration method we've been using all week
* build up from the most trivial sample inputs to the more complex
* work on your own to implement a solution
* talk to each other to review/compare solutions

### Team Echo: Homework (3:45 - 4:00)

*First* you need to make a strong effort on your enumerables. Don't finish the exercises *just* to finish them. Keep pushing until you're not able to stay deeply in the learning.

*Then* start into [this Merge Sort project](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/merge_sort.markdown) that you should have done by 9AM Monday. Ballpark that it'll take about 8-12 hours. You should use automated tests, of course :)
